structure","classNames":"","plainText":" omencss is a pure css library built with scss compiled and minified for all javascript python php etc frameworks the entire code base or partial code classes can be easily imported into your project all default browser variables are disabled this allows you to decide for your own design structure and arrangement all omencss classes have the same structure a simple explanation of this principle can be given with the help of the text-blue class 1 if the text colour for an element is to be changed the class is inserted this value is the default value for all responsive display sizes html p class=text-blue purple text p --- 1 if the text colour for an element is to be changed on small screens only 0px - 480px the class is inserted with a pre-class called sm: in the following example on small screens up to 480px width the text is displayed in purple on other screens the text is displayed in blue - as the default class is set to text-blue html p class=text-blue sm:text-purple purple text p --- 1 if the text colour for an element is to be changed on medium screens only 480px - 768px the class is inserted with a pre-class called md: in the following example on medium screens 480px - 768px width the text is displayed in purple is the screen smaller or bigger the text is displayed in blue - as the default class is set to text-blue html p class=text-blue md:text-purple purple text p --- 1 if the text colour for an element is to be changed on large screens only 768px - 1080px the class is inserted with a pre-class called lg: in the following example on medium screens 768px - 1080px width the text is displayed in purple is the screen smaller or bigger the text is displayed in blue - as the default class is set to text-blue html p class=text-blue lg:text-purple purple text p --- 1 note that this method can also be used for hover focus or active classes the same principle can be used to add a pre-class the default values in the following example shows a blue text with a blue-1 text colour on hover on small screens the text becomes red and has a hover class of red-1 html p class=text-blue hover:text-blue-1 sm:text-red hover:sm:text-red-1 purple text p values & unit sizes some classes require special mathemathical values all amounts are specified within a class this allows intuitive and easy to understand writing of css classes the value and the unit are always written after the class html opacity 1 percent p class=opacity-1per opacity text p html width 100 pixel div class=w-100px width element div html width 20 rem div class=w-20rem width element div the properties can also have netagive values those are supplemented by the -neg class html on small screens rotate the element by 180 degrees in a netagive direction div class=sm:rotate-neg-180deg rotate in negative direction div default browser values are removed 1 omencss removes all of the default values like margins paddings text-decoration headings blockquotes paragraphs input states lists border etc 2 visitors who do not want to experience animations or transitions will not register motion 3 the standard font size is automatically converted to

class does not have any pre-classes p e text-blue 5 values and unit sizes are written as a post-class - at the end of every class p e opacity-100per 6 omencss lets you conditionally apply utility classes in different states using variant modifiers such as active hover or focus statements the utility classes are entered before the default class check the adequate documentation site for the respective class p e hover:text-blue mnemonic aid: on hover set the colour to blue 7 you can also use variant modifiers to target media queries and make your website responsive within seconds the variant modifier classes are entered after the utility class and before the default class p e hover:sm:text-blue mnemonic aid: hover on small screens the text with a blue colour

classes sm: md: lg: sm: hover: active: focus: this is a headache for most post-css libraries as they are designed for normal css classes for this reason purgecss is used in this example a node must be installeda and a package json file must be included in the root folder of your project you can easily create a package json by running npm init -y in the root folder npm npm i -d purgecss 1 save purgecss as a development dependency in your project 2 in a further step a purgecss config js must be created in the root directory of your project js purgecss config js module exports = content: 'src index html' css: 'src omencss css' defaultextractor: content = content match w- : + ? !: g output: 'css omen css' 1 as content enter all your html source files 2 in css import the default omencss css file 3 defaultextractor must be adopted like and copied this as the special regex are applied here 4 in output select your public folder where the lightweight css file should be saved 5 in the html file make sure that the correct css stylesheet is selected the path must be the same as entered in the output html link rel=stylesheet href= css omen css now it is time to reduce the css file via the command line for this you have to create a script in the package json file purgecss: purgecss --config purgecss config js json name: awesome-purging version: 1 0 0 description: main: index js scripts: purgecss: purgecss --config purgecss config js keywords: author: license: isc devdependencies: purgecss: ^4 1 3 you can now purge your css infinitely enter the script npm run purgecss in the command line which takes a short moment until you get the output ⚠️ every time you change your css classes in the html file you have to purge again todo: add --watch for auto detecting changes

animation 2 clip-inset-in-top is the animation type 3 animate is the default omencss animation-duration property which lasts for 750ms 4 animation-forwards signifies that the animation should retain the current condition after completion 5 animation-delay- index + 1 1 00ms is the most important part for the stagger effect it is conditional and tied to the index the actual calculation takes place at this point index + 1 1 as a result each mapped element gets a different animation delay home has an animation-delay of 100ms brand has an animation-delay of 200ms and blog has an animation-delay of 300ms the different delays create a stagger effect a graphical overview for all animations can be found on the examples page docs animation example what exactly is a vanilla css animation? an animation represents a process which generates a moving frame for the viewer by creating and displaying individual sequences of pixels especially in web development animations can make the difference between a good and a perfect website however it should be used with caution because the boundary between perfect and too much may mean the complete opposite of what was originally intended cascading style sheets css animations usually consist of @keyframes and have different properties such as animation-name animation-duration animation-delay animation-iteration-count animation-direction animation-timing-function animation-fill-mode or animation if you use omencss you don't need to code anything omencss contains over 100 different css animations all of them are handmade a graphical overview of all animations can be found on the examples page docs animation example why you should use animations the collaboration of design and code plays an important role especially in web development nowadays a beautiful website is more or less easy to create however bringing a web application alive is more difficult the keyword for this process is animation animation originates from the latin verb animare and means as much as spirit life breath or simply to bring to life become dynamic make your beautiful website shine!
