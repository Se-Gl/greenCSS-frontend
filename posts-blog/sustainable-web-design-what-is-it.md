## Sustainable Web Design

Sustainable web design means using resources efficiently so that we don’t deplete our planet’s natural resources while designing or developing our next project. It also means making websites accessible regarding open-source, as well as that all people get easy access to the used software. In the end it’s about using fewer resources and creating less unused junk.

### But what about the design itself? Here is how to make your sustainable web design

A good first step towards sustainability is to consider the impact of your website on the environment. This includes things like the number of images used, the color palette, and whether or not the site uses JavaScript.
Blue colors, for example, require more energy. If you do decide to use JavaScript, there are some tips to help you make sure it’s as efficient as possible. Make sure that the loading time is as short as possible. Less loading time means less power consumption. NextJS for example purges all unused CSS classes automatically, this leads to a drastic reduction of loading times. In addition, you can use a JavaScript framework that only loads the content when it is supposed to be visible to the visitor.

Sustainability is an important part of any business. In fact, sustainability has become a major focus for businesses across the globe. This is because companies realize that they need to do everything possible to protect the environment and reduce their impact on the world. A green CSS library like greenCSS can be the solution. This product has been developed completely climate neutral and aims to provide sustainable development for future designers and developers.

### What makes a design sustainable

There are several ways to make a website design more sustainable. One of the easiest things to do is to adjust your color palette if necessary. Try to use more dimmed colors. Did you know that greenCSS also has a darkmode? Whitespace can also be defined as blackspace. These options help keep our planet clean while reducing the amount of pollution we produce.
In the example shown below, the parent element has a gray background and a black background in dark mode. The paragraph has a blue text color. In dark mode the color changes to a lighter shade of the blue, because the background is dark. As you can see, you can even use active, focus or hover states in dark mode.

```html
<div class="bg-gray dark:bg-black">
  <p class="text-blue dark:text-blue-10 sm:text-purple dark:sm:text-purple-10 hover:dark:sm:text-purple-5">
    Darkmode example
  </p>
</div>
```

## How can I work sustainably

In the next section, some tips and tricks will be outlined in order to familiarise yourself with the topic of sustainable web development.

### Reduce energy consumption by using the right colors

If you are looking for a simple way to reduce energy consumption, consider changing the colour scheme of your site. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the average computer monitor consumes approximately 100 watts of power. That's enough to light an entire room with 40 incandescent bulbs. In simplified terms: use more dark colors. Dark colors consume less energy on LCD screens.

In contrast to the color palette, there are images. If you want to economize your images, you should make sure that you use light images. Dark images require more storage space and consequently have longer download times. Of course, you can choose your images the way you like them. Just keep this suggestion in your mind.

![black {200x200} {caption: PNG Image 1000x1000px with a dark color: 5.94KB}](/images/blog/blogcontent/sustainable/black.webp)

![white {200x200} {caption: PNG Image 1000x1000px with a light color: 5.53KB}](/images/blog/blogcontent/sustainable/white.webp)

Even with a simple black and white comparison of a .png image, the difference is already close to 10%.

### Conscious usage of moving elements

Movement brings the web to life. Animations can help to improve the user experience and present information more effectively and purposefully. Used incorrectly, movement can confuse and disorient users, hide information or even waste much more energy than intended. On end-user devices, motion can cause the battery to drain faster. Users have to charge their devices more continuously, which leads to an increase in CO2 emissions. For users who do not want to have all animations displayed (and have noted this in their system), greenCSS offers the possibility of `prefers-reduced-motion`. This means that no CSS animation will be shown to those users.

### Web-Video

Images are the biggest causes of carbon emissions on websites. However, this is solely for the reason that videos have not become really popular (yet). Motion pictures are extremely data- as well as processing-intensive. Streaming generates about 10kg of CO2 per hour, or 2.8g per second [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2019/may/rethinking-digital-service-design-.html).

You should try to avoid to stream videos on your website if possible. After all, one second of film consumes more data than a single JPEG image in full-screen mode. If a background video is unavoidable, shorten it to only show the most important sequences. Avoid auto-playing films, not only are it is bad for the environment, it can also cause problems for users with sensory disturbances and motion sensitivity. Last but not least, you should always compress your video to the MP4 file format.

### GIF animations

GIF animations are terribly inefficient. They may be funny for the showing latest memes, but they render each image as a separate GIF image and merge them into one big file. WEBP images are far more efficient and can support animation.

### CSS and JavaScript animations

Use visual animations sparingly. Even simple effects have a significant impact on the CPU load of the devices. Enormous computing power is required, which in turn affects the battery life and the general power consumption of the consumer device.

### Sustainable font selection

The most efficient choice is always to use [system fonts](/docs/typography-font-family) e.g. Arial, Times New Roman, Helvetica, etc. With greenCSS you have direct access to all pre-installed fonts.

1. `sans` uses: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Roboto, Arial, 'Helvetica Neue', 'Segoe UI', Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', sans-serif
2. `serif` uses: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif
3. `monospace` uses: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace
4. `cursive` uses: 'Brush Script MT', cursive
5. `fantasy` uses: Copperplate, Papyrus, fantasy

Pre-installed fonts are efficient and CO2 friendly, but they do not always fit the concept and brand design. For this reason, subscription services such as Adobe Fonts or Google Fonts should be avoided. These services count the number of page views. Many API calls are caused by this process, which in turn results in a higher load on several servers and increasing emissions.

Instead, you can host your fonts yourself. First ask yourself if you really need a Thin, Extra Light, Light, Normal, Medium, Semi Bold, Bold, Extra Bold, Black and Extra Black. If not, delete the unused fonts. This saves your web hosting service, as the unused files do not have to be available 24/7. If available, use variable fonts, these are designed to allow precise scaling of thickness and skew allowing countless variations of a single font to be rendered from a single font file.

## Create an Efficient Website

1. You can make your website more efficient by using less bandwidth. This means reducing the number of images and other files that are downloaded when people visit your site.
2. Another way to save unused code, is to purge your CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) files, and compress your images before uploading them to your server - you can save them in webp format for example. This format is now supported by most browsers.

## Create An Eco friendly website

If you want to make your website more eco-friendly, here is a summary to consider:

1. Reduce the number of pages on your site or use a JavaScript Framework (like NextJS).
2. Eliminate unnecessary API calls
3. Use a responsive layout so that users can view your site on any device.
4. Use fewer images and and avoid streaming movies.
5. Optimize the images, save them e.g. as .webp or create vector graphics
6. Make use of the greenCSS colour palette to create darker designs with less tones of blue.
7. Use text instead of graphics or movies.
8. Use a font size that is readable.
9. Think about animation and its CPU load
10. Choose your font carefully and host it yourself
11. Use [greenCSS](/docs/activate-getting-started) and other green software tools

### Green Web Design Principles 2022

Responsive websites are designed to adapt to any device, so they require much less bandwidth than traditional websites. They also allow users to view the same content on multiple devices at once, saving them time and money. Additional consumers such as images or color choices should be carefully studied and adjusted over time.

### Use greenCSS instead of other CSS libraries

In production, the software developers may use green technology for designing a web application. Suitable for this purpose is greenCSS. greenCSS is an open source library that allows web designers to make their sites more sustainable. The entire library was created in a climate-neutral manner.

### Web design for sustainable brands

A lot of people think that green websites come with a high price. This is not the case. However, there are also many benefits to using a green website. Especially if the development is based on an easy to learn and sustainable CSS library. Many customers or brands can additionally be boasting when working with sustainable software. This has even been proven to increase sales.

First, it helps save the environment. Second, it is contemporary. Third, sustainability starts where everyone wants to spend time - and that's on a website. In summary, greenCSS makes your site look better because it comes with light-weight built in [animations](/docs/category/animation). In addition, you can also integrate only those CSS classes into your project that you really need.
