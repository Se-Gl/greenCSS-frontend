Sustainable web design means using fewer resources and creating less unused junk. It also means designing websites that will last for years without needing constant maintenance.

## What is sustainable webdesign

Sustainability is an important part of any business. In fact, sustainability has become a major focus for businesses across the globe. This is because companies realize that they need to do everything possible to protect the environment and reduce their impact on the world. A green CSS library like greenCSS can be the solution. This product has been developed completely climate neutral and aims to provide sustainable development for future designers and developers.

## What makes a design sustainable

There are several ways to make a website design more sustainable. One of the easiest things to do is to adjust your color palette if necessary. Try to use more dimmed colors. Did you know that greenCSS also has a darkmode? Whitespace can also be defined as blackspace. These options help keep our planet clean while reducing the amount of pollution we produce.
In the example shown below, the parent element has a gray background and a black background in dark mode. The paragraph has a blue text color. In dark mode the color changes to a lighter shade of the blue, because the background is dark. As you can see, you can even use active, focus or hover states in dark mode.

```html
<div class="bg-gray dark:bg-black">
  <p class="text-blue dark:text-blue-10 sm:text-purple dark:sm:text-purple-10 hover:dark:sm:text-purple-5">
    Darkmode example
  </p>
</div>
```

## Reduce energy consumption by using colors

If you are looking for a simple way to reduce energy consumption, consider changing the colour scheme of your site. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the average computer monitor consumes approximately 100 watts of power. That's enough to light an entire room with 40 incandescent bulbs. In simplified terms: use more dark colors. Dark colors consume less energy on LCD screens.

In contrast to the color palette, there are images. If you want to economize your images, you should make sure that you use light images. Dark images require more storage space and consequently have longer download times. Of course, you can choose your images the way you like them. Just keep this suggestion in your mind.

![black {200x200} {caption: PNG Image 1000x1000px with a dark color: 5.94KB}](/images/blog/blogcontent/sustainable/black.webp)

![white {200x200} {caption: PNG Image 1000x1000px with a light color: 5.53KB}](/images/blog/blogcontent/sustainable/white.webp)

Even with a simple black and white comparison of a .png image, the difference is already close to 10%.

## Create an Efficient Website

1. You can make your website more efficient by using less bandwidth. This means reducing the number of images and other files that are downloaded when people visit your site.
2. Another way to save unused code, is to purge your CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) files, and compress your images before uploading them to your server - you can save them in webp format for example. This format is now supported by most browsers.
