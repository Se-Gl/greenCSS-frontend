## Sustainable Software for the 21st Century

Sustainable technology is an approach that aims to reduce environmental impact by using resources in a responsible manner. It includes technologies that use renewable energy sources, recycles waste products, and reduces consumption of natural resources.
greenCSS is a free, open source CSS library designed to help you create responsive websites. It includes features like grid layouts, typography, handcrafted animations, and media queries.

## Create Responsive Websites with greenCSS

If you’re looking for a simple solution to creating responsive websites, then check out how to [install greenCSS](/docs/activate-getting-started). This open source CSS library helps you build responsive sites without having to learn any new code. The intuitive writing style is easy to learn - plus you're doing something good for the environment. Because sustainable CSS is unfortunately still rare.

### Add more than 110 different Animation Effects to Your Website

With greenCSS, you can easily add [animation effects](/examples/animation) to your website. These animations will make your website more interesting and attractive. In addition to user-friendliness, micro-interactions can be promoted to a new level. Hardly any other CSS library can compete with these out of the box features.

### Designing Custom Forms Using greenCSS - made easy

If you are looking for a simple solution to design custom forms using CSS, then greenCSS is the right choice for you. This open source library has been designed with simplicity in mind. You can use it to create any type of form you need. Or would you rather code a [hero section](/blog/how-to-create-a-responsive-hero-section)? In that case, have a look at the HTML code.

### Design Beautiful Landing Pages

A landing page is a webpage that appears when a visitor clicks on a link. It usually contains a headline, a description of the product or service offered, and some call to actions. Landing pages are often used as part of a paid advertising campaign. They are also used to promote websites and products. By the way, greenCSS.dev was created entirely with this sustainable CSS library.

## Manage Multiple Devices with One Codebase

There are many different ways to build a landing page. You can use any web framework which features HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, etc. However, one of the biggest challenges web designers are facing is to manage multiple devices. If you design a site using responsive design, then you need to make sure that everything looks good on mobile phones, tablets, laptops, desktops, and TVs. With greenCSS you will never write again annoying media queries.

Use variant modifiers to target media queries like responsive breakpoints.

| media query | Range          | greenCSS example |
| ----------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| sm:         | 0px - 480px    | sm:bg-red        |
| md:         | 480px - 768px  | md:bg-blue       |
| lg:         | 768px - 1080px | lg:bg-yellow     |

The output in your HTML looks like `{media query}:{classname}`.

```html
<div class="bg-green sm:bg-red md:bg-blue lg:bg-yellow">{children}</div>
```

The default background color in this example is green. This CSS class retains its status if no other media queries are specified. In the example above, all displays larger than 1080px would show a green background (because sm, md and lg were provided). Small screens have a red background, while medium screens show a blue color and large screens will display a yellow background color.

The result is impressive. With only one line of code, responsive web elements can be created and styled.

## The Solution - sustainable CSS

CSS has been developed to make web pages more accessible to people who are visually impaired. However, CSS is not designed to be sustainable. This means that it does not take into account the environment when creating websites.

greenCSS provides a solution. It is easy and intuitive to learn, responsive, has animations and covers all CSS classes - and best of all, it is sustainable and available for all frameworks.
