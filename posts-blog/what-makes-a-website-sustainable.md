The Internet is digital and technical. It also comes with a significant physical price tag. This is evidenced by using specific files, colors, videos, streams through programming languages to servers, just to name a few. These attributes factor into the decisions we make in our web projects - and each decision can be the cause of more power consumption and ultimately more C02 emissions. According to [theshiftproject](theshiftproject.org), digital technologies - which include websites - emit 4% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In summary, as the web grows, this trend will not decrease and the cost to our environment will increase.

## What is a sustainable website?

In principle, some obvious and less evident factors need to be considered to determine if a web application is sustainable.

Theoretically, no website is climate neutral. It starts with the programmer or an agency that creates a homepage. At least one computer must be running at all times for programming, designing and marketing. To prevent a computer or laptop from overheating, it must be cooled constantly. If a computer has a powerful graphics card or other above-average components, the energy required for cooling will increase proportionally.

In addition, a web application must be available 24/7. Therefore a reliable web host server is needed, which has a high uptime rate. The server is running all the time and needs to be cooled permanently - which causes an additional emission potential.

Finally, the website should be visited. A website visitor uses a technical device - such as a smartphone, tablet, laptop or desktop computer. The device had to be manufactured beforehand. Depending on the type, this already left an immense bad footprint. Besides the device, an internet provider is needed to connect to the website. It must also run around the clock in order to provide the fastest possible access to the website.

A website alone may have a small impact. However, the entire Internet produces an annual emission equivalent to Germany. If it was a country, it would be the sixth most polluted.

According to these results, no website can truly be climate neutral. However, greenCSS aims to ensure that every website could leave a greener footprint, no matter how small it may be. Thus, any website may be designed to be more carbon-neutral.

### Sustainable Design

Sustainable web design is an approach of designing web services that prioritizes the health of our planet. In essence, the aim is to reduce CO2 emissions and reduce energy consumption. And this is where greenCSS comes into action. As we learned earlier, it is not possible to create a completely emission-free website. Nevertheless, greenCSS has made it its goal to compensate for CO2 in a climate-neutral way. So far (as of May 2022) the entire project has produced about 100kg of carbon dioxide in Switzerland. It is planned that trees will be planted in the nearby area as compensation.

greenCSS is a climate neutral, freely available, open source CSS library. Thanks to donations, trees can be planted worldwide - in cooperation with partners. For you as a designer or developer, this means that you can offer zero-emission software.

### Sustainable Webdesign

Sustainable web design does not mean that outdated technology is used. On the contrary! greenCSS uses SASS (SCSS) like Bulma. As a result, a complete CSS file can be imported into your project. That means that greenCSS can be used for all JavaScript, PHP, Python and so on Frameworks. We use a classical, but more intuitive class-based notation like tailwindcss.
And last but not least, you can use over 100 different hand-made animations, which are provided to complement the sustainable software. That means you do not have to go through the hassle of creating animations, just check out the [animation examples](/examples/animation) and choose your favorite motion.

## Create Best Environmental Websites

You want to develop a sustainable software - but you do not know how to start? Check out our blog tutorial on how to [create a hero section](blog/how-to-create-a-responsive-hero-section). It will show you step by step how to create a sustainable hero section in vanilla HTML/CSS or with NextJS. At the same time you will learn how to write greenCSS with the help of a real world project. In addition, the entire code base for the greenCSS web application is freely available on github.

### Web Design for Sustainable Brands

Sustainable brands usually aim to ensure that the greatest amount of information is presented in a compact manner. Minimalist web design does not mean that our designs have to be bald. It means that we can justify the existence of every detail.

However, this does not mean that a website may have no content at all. It means that images, videos and colors should be used carefully. Loading times should be kept as low as possible. This way images, for example, can be compressed and saved in a web friendly format - like \*.webp.

### What is Good for Your Website

UX designers have an enormous impact on the environmental footprint of a web presence. Even if the sustainability is completely ignored at all stages of a project - which can lead to inefficient code and poorly environmentally friendly hosting - the information architecture and user experience can limit the impact of such late-breaking decisions.

### How to Make a Sustainable Webproject

Data transfers correlate strongly with energy consumption. The more data the user loads, the more electricity is required and the more CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere. An average web page is 2MB-5MB in size. Every step in a user journey has a significant impact on the environment. Well-structured design helps to reduce it.

1. Unnecessary API calls to external servers should be avoided if possible.
2. Similar content could be merged into one document.
3. Images should be compressed and adjusted for the respective screen sizes. The Webp image format is about 30% smaller than JPG. AVIF, one of the newest image formats is even up to 50% smaller than WEBP. However, it does not have adequate compatibility yet. For icons, no image has to be used as it can be saved and utilized as SVG.
4. Streamline the content. NextJS, for example, loads data dynamically. Code blocks and images are not loaded until the user explicitly accesses them.

Colors should not be neglected or forgotten when it comes to power consumption. Most modern smartphones, laptops or screens use OLED technology. Each pixel is illuminated individually. The use of dark shades or darker colors can lead to a reduction in the energy consumption. Google reports that the screen is actually the largest single power consumer for smartphones.

1. Black is the most efficient color for OLED screens.
2. Blue pixels consume 25% more power than green or red pixels.

## Conclusion

If we keep minimalism in mind, we can do more with less. Every detail should be questioned. Do we really need this color, this font, this video. By questioning, we can not only reduce the emissions of products, but also make them more effective for the environment, users and businesses. Design decisions have an impact on the power demand of a digital product. By using greenCSS, the emissions for the development can drastically be reduced up to the production stage.
