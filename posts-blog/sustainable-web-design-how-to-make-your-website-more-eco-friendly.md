## Sustainable Web Design

Sustainable web design means using resources efficiently so that we don’t deplete our planet’s natural resources while designing or developing our next project. It also means making websites accessible regarding open-source, as well as that all people get easy access to the used software.

### But what about the design itself? Here is how to make your sustainable web design

A good first step towards sustainability is to consider the impact of your website on the environment. This includes things like the number of images used, the color palette, and whether or not the site uses JavaScript.
Blue colors, for example, require more energy. If you do decide to use JavaScript, there are some tips to help you make sure it’s as efficient as possible. Make sure that the loading time is as short as possible. Less loading time means less power consumption. NextJS for example purges all unused CSS classes automatically, this leads to a drastic reduction of loading times. In addition, you can use a JavaScript framework that only loads the content when it is supposed to be visible to the visitor.

### Green Web Design Principles 2022

Responsive websites are designed to adapt to any device, so they require much less bandwidth than traditional websites. They also allow users to view the same content on multiple devices at once, saving them time and money. Additional consumers such as images or color choices should be carefully studied and adjusted over time.

## Use greenCSS Instead of other CSS libraries

In production, the software developers may use green technology for designing a web application. Suitable for this purpose is greenCSS. greenCSS is an open source library that allows web designers to make their sites more sustainable. The entire library was created in a climate-neutral manner.

### web design for sustainable brands

A lot of people think that green websites come with a high price. This is not the case. However, there are also many benefits to using a green website. Especially if the development is based on an easy to learn and sustainable CSS library. Many customers or brands can additionally be boasting when working with sustainable software. This has even been proven to increase sales.

First, it helps save the environment. Second, it is contemporary. Third, sustainability starts where everyone wants to spend time - and that's on a website. In summary, greenCSS makes your site look better because it comes with built in [animations](/docs/category/animation).

## Create An Eco friendly website

If you want to make your website more eco-friendly, here are some tips to consider:

1. Reduce the number of pages on your site or use a JavaScript Framework (like NextJS).
2. Use a responsive layout so that users can view your site on any device.
3. Use fewer images.
4. Optimize the images, save them e.g. as .webp or create vector graphics
5. Use fewer colors.
6. Use text instead of graphics.
7. Use a font size that is readable.
8. Use a dark background color.
9. Use a light gray background color.
10. Use a white background color.
