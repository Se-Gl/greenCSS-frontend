plainText: 'This article introduces omenCSS. omenCSS is a class-based CSS library. The primary focus is on responsive design, as the credo is "all screens first", which stands in contrast to the common "mobile first".

The intention of omenCSS is to be accessible for EVERYBODY. This means, that omenCSS will always be free and the source code is publicly available (MIT license). Since the library is built with SCSS, omenCSS can be used on all frameworks like Django, Flask, React, Vue, Next, Nuxt, Laravel and even on vanilla HTML - just to name a few examples. omenCSS is responsive - write HTML design for smartphone, tablet, screenreader, laptop, desktop or 4k screens. omenCSS is dynamic - no additional library for animations is necessary. All animations are already implemented. Examples can be viewed here. omenCSS is MIT licensed. The source code can be viewed here. What exactly is omenCSS? For the completion of my bachelor thesis at code university in Berlin in software development, I decided to create a open source CSS library. The principle, as well as the usability should be as simple as possible. In addition to the core library, custom HTML elements are planned to be developed, e.g. to provide animations on scroll or to create further reusable components (as of February 2022). In addition, a separate implementation of a purge function to exclude unnecessary css classes is planned.
