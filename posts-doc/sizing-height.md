| _greenCSS_ | CSS class example          | minimum Value | maximum Value | Step |
| --------- | -------------------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ---- |
| h-{size}  | .h-1px { height: 1px; }    | h-0px         | h-100px       | 1px  |
| h-{size}  | .h-11rem { height: 1rem; } | h-11rem       | h-100rem      | 1rem |
| h-{size}  | .h-1% { height: 1%; }      | h-0per        | h-100per      | 1%   |
| h-{size}  | .h-1vw { height: 1vw; }    | h-0vw         | h-100vw       | 1vw  |

## Fixed heights

Control the height on every HTML element by using the h-{size} utility with a postfix variable - like `{-px | -rem | -vw}`.

1. The pixel height class range is from 0 to positive 100 and uses the [px] postfix. The steps are +/- 1px. e.g. `h-0px, h-1px,... h-100px`

2. The rem height class range is from positive 11rem to positive 100rem and uses the [rem] postfix. The steps are +/- 1rem. e.g. `h-11rem, h-12rem,... h-100rem`. ‚ö†Ô∏è Remember 1rem = 10px or 10rem = 100px

3. The viewport height class range is from 0vw to positive 100vw and uses the [vw] postfix. The steps are +/- 1vw. e.g. `h-0vw, h-1vw,... h-100vw`. Use h-100vw to make an element span the entire height of the viewport.

```html
<div class="h-50px">h-50px</div>
<!-- 50rem is equal to: 500px -->
<div class="h-50rem">h-50rem</div>
<!-- 50per is equal to: 50% -->
<div class="h-50per">h-50per</div>
<!-- 50vw is equal to: viewport height of 50 -->
<div class="h-50vw">h-50vw</div>
```

## Percentage heights

Control the percentage height on every HTML element by using the h-{size} utility with the postfix variable `{-per}`.

1. The percentage height class range is from 0 to positive 100 and uses the [per] postfix. The steps are +/- 1%. e.g. `h-0per, h-1per,... h-100per`

```html
<div class="h-50per">h-50per</div>
```

## Reset height

The `{h-auto}` utility can be useful if you need to remove an element‚Äôs assigned height under a specific condition, like at a particular [breakpoint](/blog/responsive-greenCSS-breakpoints):

```html
<div class="h-full sm:h-auto">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

## Active, focus, and hover states

| _greenCSS_       | CSS class example                      | Range                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| active:h-{size} | .active\:h-1px:active { height: 1px; } | active:h-0px to active:h-100px |
| focus:h-{size}  | .focus\:h-1px:focus { height: 1px; }   | focus:h-0px to focus:h-100px   |
| hover:h-{size}  | .hover\:h-1px:focus { height: 1px; }   | hover:h-0px to hover:h-100px   |

greenCSS let you conditionally apply utility classes for different page states. Thereby different variant modifiers are being used - for example, use `hover:h-10px` to only apply the h-10px utility on hover.

```html
<div class="h-50px hover:h-20px">h-50px</div>
```

## Responsive Breakpoints

Use variant modifiers to target media queries like responsive breakpoints.

| media query | Range          | greenCSS example |
| ----------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| sm:         | 0px - 480px    | .sm:h-10px      |
| md:         | 480px - 768px  | .md:h-10px      |
| lg:         | 768px - 1080px | .lg:h-10px      |

greenCSS media queries can also be combined with active, focus and hover states. For example, use `sm:h-10px` to apply the h-10px utility at only small screen sizes at or below 480px. Or `active:md:h-10px` to apply the h-10px utility at only between small screen sizes (480px) and medium screen sizes (768px).

1. The structure is as follows: `{conditional state}:{media query}:{classname}{size}` p.e. `active:md:m-10px`

## Executive Summary

When you vocalize the class names, it helps you to learn and remember the classes, as well as the structure. You can say:
